# make

## make

* Automatically build software / libraries / documents by specifying dependencies through a Make file

* Originally created by Stuart Feldman in 1976 at Bell Labs

* Almost universally available (all flavors of unix / linux / osx)

## Makefile

A `Makefile` provides a list of target files along with their dependencies and the steps necessary to generate each of the targets.

```make
target1: depend1 depend2 depend3 ...
    step1
    step2
    step3
    ...

depend1: depend1.1
    step1
    step2
```

## Makefile (simple example)

```make
paper.pdf: paper.tex Fig1/fig.pdf Fig2/fig.pdf
    pdflatex paper

Fig1/fig.pdf: Fig1/fig.R
    cd Fig1;Rscript fig.R

Fig2/fig.pdf: Fig2/fig.R
    cd Fig2;Rscript fig.R
```

## Intelligent Building

Because the `Makefile` specifies the dependency structure `make` knows when a file has changed (by examining the file's modification timestamp) and only runs the steps that depend on the file or files that have changed.

<br/>

* After running `make` the first time, I edit `paper.tex`, what steps run if I run `make` again?

* What about editing `fig1.R`?


## Variables

Like R or shell scripts or almost any other language we can define variables

```make
R_OPTS=--no-save --no-restore --no-site-file --no-init-file --no-environ

Fig1/fig.pdf: Fig1/fig.R
    cd Fig1;Rscript $(R_OPTS) fig.R
```

## Special Targets {.smaller}

By default is you run `make` with arguments it will attempt to build the first target in the `Makefile` whose name does not start with a `.`. By convention we often include an `all` target which explicitly specifies how to build everything within a project.

<br/>

`all` is an example of what is called a phony target - because there is no `all` file in the directory. Other common phony targets:

* clean - remove any files created by the Makefile, restores to the original state

* install - for software packages, installs the compiled programs / libraries / headers

<br/>


We list all phony targets by including the line like the following:

```make
.PHONY: all clean all
```


## Builtin Variables

* `$@` &nbsp;&nbsp; the file name of the target

* `$<` &nbsp;&nbsp; the name of the first dependency

* `$^` &nbsp;&nbsp; the names of all dependencies

* `$(@D)` &nbsp;&nbsp; the directory part of the target

* `$(@F)` &nbsp;&nbsp; the file part of the target

* `$(<D)` &nbsp;&nbsp; the directory part of the first dependency

* `$(<F)` &nbsp;&nbsp; the file part of the first dependency


## Pattern Rules

Often we want to build several files in the same way, in these cases we can use `%` as a special wildcard character to match both targets and dependencies.

So we can go from

```make
Fig1/fig.pdf: Fig1/fig.R
    cd R;Rscript fig.R

Figs2/fig.pdf: Fig1/fig.R
    cd R;Rscript fig.R
```

to

```make
Fig%/fig.pdf: Fig%/fig.R
    cd $(<D);Rscript $(<F)
```

## Makefile (fancy example)

```make
all: paper.pdf

paper.pdf: paper.tex Fig1/fig.pdf Fig2/fig.pdf
    pdflatex paper

Fig%/fig.pdf: Fig%/fig.R
    cd $(<D);Rscript $(<F)

clean:
    rm -f paper.aux
    rm -f paper.log
    rm -f paper.synctex.gz
    rm -f paper.pdf
    rm -f Figs/*.pdf

.PHONY: all clean
```
