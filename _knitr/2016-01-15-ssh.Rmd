# ssh

## Secure shell (ssh)

* A secure tool for connecting and interacting with remote systems
* Uses public key encryption
* Run a single command or work interactively
* Lots of other neat tricks (proxy, port forwarding, many more)

## Connecting to saxon

* Everyone should have a visitor account of the stats servers now
* Try to connect to make sure everything is working...

```
$ ssh cr173@saxon.stat.duke.edu
The authenticity of host 'saxon.stat.duke.edu (152.3.7.55)' can't be established
.
RSA key fingerprint is 74:30:5a:d0:cd:a8:d2:6f:a6:e9:c6:80:bb:eb:b4:ba.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?yes
cr173@saxon.stat.duke.edu's password:
[cr173@saxon ~]$
```

## Working remotely

You should now be able to run commands remotely on `saxon`. We can interactively run commands on the remote system. Try `hostname` to see which system you are connected to, and `whoami` to see your user name.

```
cr173@saxon [~]$ hostname
saxon.stat.duke.edu
cr173@saxon [~]$ whoami
cr173
```

## Finishing up

Once you are done on the server you can exit by:

* Running `exit`
* Ctrl-D
* Wait long enough (connection will time out)
